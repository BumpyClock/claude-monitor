# Claude Monitor

A comprehensive real-time monitoring dashboard for tracking Claude Code usage, tool usage, token consumption, and session analytics. The goal is to make it easy to see your usage and add some traceability to Claude code so you can debug claude code agents and usage more effectively. It's built on the amazing work by @disler and @ryoppippi.

This is in active development and something I made for myself, I make no guarantees that it will work for everyone and that it won't set your machine on fire. Use at your own risk. 

## üôè Credits

This aggregates a few ideas from the community for an easy to use monitoring solution so you can track your CC usage. Shoutout to @disler and @ryoppippi for their projects and work on which this is built. 

- **Claude Code Hook Scripts** - Python hook implementations from [claude-code-hooks-multi-agent-observability](https://github.com/disler/claude-code-hooks-multi-agent-observability) by [@disler](https://github.com/disler)
- **CCUsage** - Claude Code usage tracking library from [ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage) by [@ryoppippi](https://github.com/ryoppippi)

Special thanks to the contributors of these projects for providing the foundation that makes Claude Monitor possible.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd claude-monitor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   - Configure the necessary environment variables
   - Start tracking all Claude Code activities

## üìö Documentation

- **[Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Detailed system architecture, tech stack, and project structure
- **[Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md)** - Environment variables, hook setup, and customization options

## üìà Usage Analytics

### Token Metrics Tracked
- **Input Tokens**: User prompts and context
- **Output Tokens**: Claude's responses
- **Cache Read**: Cached content retrieval
- **Cache Creation**: New cache entries

### Cost Calculations
Automatically calculates costs based on current Claude API pricing:
- Input: $0.003 per 1K tokens
- Output: $0.015 per 1K tokens
- Cache operations tracked separately

### Session Management
- Tracks multiple concurrent Claude Code sessions
- Session-based filtering and analytics
- Historical data retention

## üîß Development

### Scripts
```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start dev server
pnpm build            # Build for production
pnpm preview          # Preview production build
pnpm type-check       # Run TypeScript checks

# Testing
pnpm test             # Run tests (if configured)
```

### Database Schema
The monitor uses SQLite with the following main tables:
- `events`: All Claude Code events and activities
- `themes`: User theme preferences
- Additional tables for session and usage tracking
